# Apple's System_7.0.1.smi.bin is a Self Mounting Image, which needs a running
# System 7 to open -- the chicken-and-egg problem Gryphel's recipe solves:
#   https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/recipes/sys7inst/
# Boot something that already runs, use ImportFl to bring the .smi.bin inside,
# then run Apple's installer onto disk1.
