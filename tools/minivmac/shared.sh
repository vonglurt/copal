# shared.sh -- move files between the host and the emulated Mac.
#
# Mini vMac has no host folder sharing. There is no equivalent of a VM shared
# directory: the emulated Mac sees disk images and nothing else. What works
# instead is a dedicated HFS volume that both sides can touch --
# mounted as a disk inside the emulator, and read/written on the host with
# hfsutils (hformat, hmount, hcopy, hdir).
#
# The catch worth knowing up front: do NOT write to shared.dsk from the host
# while the emulator has it mounted. Both sides cache HFS metadata and neither
# expects the other; you will corrupt the volume. Quit the emulator first.
#
# Usage:
#     ./shared.sh init [MB]        create and format the volume (default 20 MB)
#     ./shared.sh put FILE...      copy files from the host into it
#     ./shared.sh get FILE...      copy files out of it to ./shared/
#     ./shared.sh ls               list what is on it
#

error: hfsutils is not installed.

It provides hformat/hmount/hcopy/hdir, which read and write classic HFS
volumes -- the filesystem a Mac Plus uses. HFS+ tools (hfsprogs) are a
different thing and will not work here.

    Alpine :  apk add hfsutils
    macOS  :  brew install hfsutils

Without it you can still move files by mounting shared.dsk in the emulator,
but only from the Mac side.
