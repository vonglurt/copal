#  COPAL ALPINE LINUX -- collect the answers an unattended install needs.
#
# `make answers` asks the handful of questions that would otherwise stop the
# install dead an hour in, and writes them to answers.txt in the project root.
# copal-prep.sh sources that file at build time and copies the COPAL_* values
# onto the card, where copal-init.sh reads them back.
#
# THE PASSWORD IS NOT STORED. What is stored is its SHA-512 crypt hash -- the
# same string /etc/shadow holds -- so the file, and every image built from it,
# can be read by anyone without giving up the password. Stage 1 applies it with
# `chpasswd -e`, which takes an already-hashed value.
#
# THE DEFAULT IS 'hunter2', AND IT IS A JOKE PASSWORD ON A REAL MACHINE. It is
# here because automated testing needs a password it already knows, and that is
# the only thing it is good for. What is actually being built is not a toy:
#
#   - openssh is installed and running from stage 1 (SSHDOPTS="-c openssh")
#   - the login user shares root's password, and sshd's AllowUsers permits
#     exactly that account
#   - root over SSH is always refused, but PASSWORD authentication is left ON
#     whenever no SSH key was installed -- see stage 13, which keeps it rather
#     than locking someone off a board they would have to fetch. So on a build
#     with no key, 'user' plus this password is a working network login
#   - the guest has its own address on the host network, a full compiler
#     toolchain, and everything needed to run a server
#
# A key from this Mac is installed by default, and stage 13 turns password
# authentication off when it finds one -- which is the single fact that makes
# the default defensible at all. Build with CFG_SSHKEY= to skip the key, or
# put the machine anywhere that matters, and 'hunter2' is exactly as bad as it
# looks. Set a real one here; that is the whole point of this being a file you
# can edit.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/copal-answers.sh              ask, then write answers.txt
#   tools/copal-answers.sh --show       print the current answers, no password
#   tools/copal-answers.sh --force      overwrite without confirming
