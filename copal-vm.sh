#  COPAL LINUX -- boot a Copal disk image in QEMU on Apple Silicon.
#
# copal-prep.sh writes the image; this runs it. Written as a separate script
# rather than folded into the prep because the two have different lifetimes:
# an image is prepared once and booted many times, usually while changing
# something and looking again.
#
# Usage:
#   ./copal-vm.sh                          boot ./copal-vm.img, serial here
#   ./copal-vm.sh path/to/other.img        boot a different image
#   ./copal-vm.sh --graphical              open a window instead of serial
#   ./copal-vm.sh --log boot.log           also tee the serial to a file
#   ./copal-vm.sh --snapshot               discard all writes on exit
#   ./copal-vm.sh --check                  boot, capture, report, exit
#
#   MEM=4096 CPUS=4 ./copal-vm.sh          override the defaults
#
# --check is the automated one: it boots headless with no terminal attached,
# waits for the system to come up or for a known failure to appear, prints a
# verdict and exits non-zero if the boot did not reach a login prompt. That is
# the thing to run after changing copal-prep.sh, and it takes about a minute
# instead of a card and a reboot.
#
# Ctrl-A X quits a serial session. Ctrl-A C reaches the QEMU monitor.

# and will happily put them ahead of the disk in BootOrder. QEMU's user-mode
# network answers no DHCP offer, so each one runs to its own timeout first:
#
#     >>Start PXE over IPv4.
#       PXE-E16: No valid offer received.
#     BdsDxe: failed to load Boot0002 "UEFI PXEv4 ..." : Not Found

#
# which is a minute or more of nothing before the disk is even tried. It is not
# a hang, but it looks like one. Removing the ROM removes the entries; the
# guest still gets a working NIC, because Linux drives virtio-net itself and
# has no use for the firmware's PXE stack.
#
# bootindex=0 on the disk is the other half, and the one that does not depend
# on the variable store: it tells the firmware which device to try first
# regardless of what a previous boot recorded in BootOrder. Without it, a fresh
# store boots straight to disk and a used one may not -- which is exactly the
# difference that made this invisible in testing.
