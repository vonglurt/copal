#  COPAL ALPINE LINUX -- wrap a prepared image in a UTM virtual machine.
#
# copal-prep.sh writes a disk image. copal-vm.sh boots one under plain QEMU.
# This makes one into a UTM VM instead -- a registered machine with a name, an
# icon, NAT networking, a forwarded SSH port and a shared folder, that starts
# from the UTM window or from utmctl.
#
# WHY BOTH, and which to use:
#
#   copal-vm.sh   Automated verification. Boots headless with the serial
#                 console redirected to a file, greps it for a login prompt or
#                 a known failure, and exits non-zero if the boot did not come
#                 up. That is the thing to run after changing the installer.
#
#   utm-vm.sh     Interactive use. A window to watch i3 come up in, a NAT'd
#                 network you can SSH into, and a folder shared with the Mac.
#                 That is the thing to run when you want to USE the system.
#
# UTM stores a VM as a bundle directory -- config.plist beside a Data/ holding
# the disk -- under its sandbox container. Writing that bundle is all it takes
# to register a machine; UTM notices it. Every key written here was checked
# against the UTM 4.7.4 binary rather than guessed.
#
# Usage:
#   utm/utm-vm.sh create  --target aarch64 --image build/copal-vm.img
#   utm/utm-vm.sh share   --target aarch64 --share ~/Downloads/SharedVM
#   utm/utm-vm.sh start   --target aarch64
#   utm/utm-vm.sh status  --target aarch64
#   utm/utm-vm.sh stop    --target aarch64
#   utm/utm-vm.sh refresh --target aarch64 --image build/copal-vm.img
#   utm/utm-vm.sh export  --target aarch64 --image build/copal-vm.img
#   utm/utm-vm.sh delete  --target aarch64
#   utm/utm-vm.sh config  --target x86_64        # print the plist, write nothing
#   utm/utm-vm.sh progress --target x86_64       # how far the install has got
#   utm/utm-vm.sh log     --target x86_64        # follow the install transcript
#   utm/utm-vm.sh layout                         # arrange the VM windows on screen
#   utm/utm-vm.sh layout --autotype              # ...and log in and start the install
#   utm/utm-vm.sh layout --no-start              # arrange only; do not start VMs
#   utm/utm-vm.sh layout --probe                 # can the consoles be read? moves nothing
#
#   GPU=plain utm/utm-vm.sh create --target aarch64      # no host acceleration
#     GPU picks the display device at create time. The aarch64 default is
#     ramfb-gl: VirGL through Metal, plus a framebuffer the firmware can draw
#     on so the boot is visible even if the acceleration is not. plain is the
#     paravirtualised GPU with no acceleration; gl is VirGL without the
#     framebuffer; ramfb is a bare framebuffer for bringing up a machine that
#     will not display any other way. 'copal-gpu' in the guest reports which
#     of them is actually doing the work.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- autotype --
-- Only if AUTOTYPE is 1. The windows are placed either way; starting an
-- install is a separate decision from tidying the desktop, and running it by
-- accident costs an hour.
--
-- What it types, into each serial console: "root", Enter -- the account has a
-- blank password until stage 1 sets one -- then the path to the installer.
-- Then it stops. Everything after that is answered inside the guest from
-- answers.txt, which is far steadier than timing keystrokes against a stage
-- that can take twenty minutes on the emulated x86_64 machine.
--
-- Each thing typed waits for the prompt that reads it -- the login prompt,
-- the password prompt, the installer's first question -- rather than for a
-- number of seconds someone guessed. See waitFor above for what happens when
-- the console cannot be read at all.
--
-- THE RULE THAT MATTERS, and it is a safety rule rather than a nicety:
-- keystrokes go to whichever window is frontmost AT THE MOMENT THEY ARE SENT,
-- and these waits are long -- ten minutes for a login prompt, five for the
-- installer's question. Whoever started this has every right to go and use
-- their Mac in the meantime. So the window is raised and proved frontmost
-- immediately before every single keystroke, never once at the start, and if
-- it cannot be proved the console is abandoned with nothing typed.
--
-- And a wait that simply runs out types NOTHING. The old behaviour -- wait,
-- give up, type anyway -- is how "root" ends up in somebody's browser ten
-- minutes after they stopped watching. A prompt that never came is a reason
-- to stop and say so, not a reason to type into the dark.
-- ------------------------------------------------ reading the console ---
-- WHY READ AT ALL: the machines do not boot at the same speed. The aarch64
-- one reaches a login prompt in seconds; the emulated x86_64 one can take
-- minutes, and how many minutes depends on what else this Mac is doing. Any
-- fixed delay is therefore either a wait that is too long every single time
-- or a wait that is too short on the day it matters, and a keystroke sent
-- early is not queued -- it lands in the boot messages scrolling past and is
-- gone. So: watch the window, and type when the prompt is actually there.
--
-- WHAT IS READ: the accessibility text of the serial console window, the
-- same thing VoiceOver would say. Nothing is read from disk and nothing
-- leaves this Mac.
--
-- WHEN IT CANNOT BE READ: UTM is free to draw its terminal in a way that
-- exposes no text to accessibility, and older versions do. That is not
-- treated as an error -- grabText simply comes back empty, waitFor says so,
-- and the typing falls back to the fixed delays this script used before.
-- Slower and blinder, but it still works.

-- Walk a window's UI elements and collect whatever text they carry. Depth
-- limited because the tree is not ours and need not be shallow; every access
-- is wrapped because elements come and go while a terminal is redrawing, and
-- a vanished element throws rather than returning missing value.

# ------------------------------------------------------------- the layout ---
# Four windows come out of two running machines -- a serial console and a
# graphical console each -- and UTM opens them stacked on top of one another
# wherever it likes. This puts them where they are useful: the two serial
# consoles flush into the bottom corners where the install can be watched, and
# the two graphical consoles pushed down off the bottom edge, overlapping, so
# they are out of the way but still clickable when i3 is worth looking at.
#
# THE PERMISSION, which is the whole difficulty. Moving another application's
# windows goes through the Accessibility API, and macOS grants that per
# SENDING process. A terminal is a bad sender: the grant is recorded against
# the terminal binary, prompts do not always appear, and a denial is
# remembered with no way to ask again -- 'tccutil reset' did not clear it here.
# Script Editor is a good sender. It is Apple-signed, it has its own clean
# permission record, and it prompts reliably.
#
# So this tries the direct route, and when that is refused it hands the script
# to Script Editor for YOU to read and run. That is not only a workaround: a
# script that is about to be granted control of your desktop is a script worth
# reading first, and the file it opens says at the top exactly what it touches.
# The two machines this repository makes, by exact name -- the same list the
# Makefile's purge target uses. Nothing else in UTM is touched.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------ plist ---
# Written as XML rather than through PlistBuddy: the whole configuration is
# visible in one place, which matters when the question is "why did it not
# boot" and the answer is one wrong key.
#
# Deliberate choices, each with a reason:
#
#   Network.Mode               Two NATs, and the difference matters more than
#       the name suggests. Verified by reading the QEMU command line UTM
#       actually builds, not from the documentation:
#
#         Shared   -> -netdev vmnet-shared    Apple's vmnet framework. The
#             guest gets a DHCP lease on 192.168.64.0/24 and is REACHABLE FROM
#             THE HOST at that address. ICMP works, so ping is a real test, and
#             throughput is far better than slirp. This is the default.
#
#         Emulated -> -netdev user,hostfwd=   slirp. The guest is unreachable
#             from outside, which is the problem host port forwarding exists to
#             work around. Slower, and ICMP is silently dropped.
#
#       PortForward is only honoured in Emulated mode. UTM accepts the key in
#       Shared mode and ignores it -- no hostfwd appears on the command line --
#       so writing one there is a config that lies about what it does. Hence
#       the block below is emitted only for Emulated, and 'utm-vm.sh ip' exists
#       to find the guest's real address in Shared mode.
#
#   Serial Mode = Terminal     Matches a VM already working on this machine.
#       A Display AND a Serial are both configured on purpose: the window
#       shows i3 when stage 4 has run, the serial shows kernel messages when
#       it has not.
#
#   UEFIBoot = true            The image has an EFI system partition with
#       GRUB on it at EFI/BOOT/BOOT{AA64,X64}.EFI. UTM supplies the matching
#       edk2 firmware and creates its own variable store on first start --
#       which is why one is NOT written here.
#
#   Display Hardware -- set by GPU= on the create command line.
#
#       The default is virtio-gpu-pci on aarch64 and virtio-vga on x86_64:
#       the paravirtualised GPU, no host acceleration. The guest drives it
#       with the kernel's virtio_gpu KMS driver and X's modesetting driver on
#       top -- which is the pairing stage 4 now installs in a guest, instead
#       of the fbdev driver it uses on a Pi. That change is where the display
#       speed actually came from: fbdev on a KMS device goes through the
#       kernel's framebuffer emulation, which keeps a shadow copy of the
#       screen, write-protects it, and takes a page fault on every write.
#       Every pixel drawn twice, with a trap in between.
#
#       The accelerated ones add VirGL: the guest's mesa encodes GL commands,
#       UTM replays them on the Mac's GPU through Metal, and X's glamor
#       becomes real acceleration rather than llvmpipe on the CPU.
#
#         GPU=ramfb-gl   virtio-ramfb-gl. THE DEFAULT on aarch64.
#                        Two devices in one: a ramfb -- a plain linear
#                        framebuffer the firmware can draw on with no driver
#                        at all -- alongside the accelerated virtio-gpu the
#                        guest kernel takes over once it is up.
#
#                        That first half is the whole reason to prefer it
#                        here. ARM's 'virt' machine has no VGA, so with a
#                        pure virtio-gpu device NOTHING draws until Linux has
#                        bound the virtio_gpu driver: the UEFI menu, GRUB and
#                        the early kernel messages all happen on a black
#                        window. With ramfb they are visible. On a machine
#                        whose failure mode is "the window stayed black",
#                        being able to see the firmware is the difference
#                        between a diagnosis and a guess -- it says whether
#                        the guest got as far as loading a driver at all.
#
#         GPU=gl         virtio-gpu-gl-pci (virtio-vga-gl on x86_64). The
#                        same VirGL acceleration without the ramfb half, so
#                        boot is black on ARM until the driver loads. The one
#                        to try if ramfb-gl misbehaves; on x86_64 it is the
#                        only accelerated option, because virtio-vga is
#                        already the VGA-compatible device and ramfb has
#                        nothing to add.
#
#         GPU=ramfb      ramfb alone. No acceleration and no KMS -- a linear
#                        framebuffer and nothing else, which puts X back on
#                        fbdev and back to being slow. Here for bringing up a
#                        machine that will not display any other way, not for
#                        running one.
#
#         GPU=plain      the default, spelled out.
#
#       WHY THE ACCELERATED ONE IS THE DEFAULT ON AARCH64, when the argument
#       against it used to be persuasive. The objection was the failure mode:
#       a slightly slow guest is still usable, while a VirGL guest whose host
#       renderer refuses is a black window with no console to fix it from, and
#       a default is what somebody unfamiliar gets on their first attempt.
#
#       ramfb is the answer to that, and it is the whole reason this device
#       rather than virtio-gpu-gl-pci is the one promoted. The framebuffer
#       half needs no driver and no renderer: it draws from the first frame of
#       firmware, before Linux exists, and it keeps drawing whatever happens
#       to the accelerated half afterwards. The black-window failure this was
#       guarding against is the failure the device removes. What is left if
#       VirGL does not come up is a guest that is merely unaccelerated -- the
#       old default -- which you can see, log into, and diagnose.
#
#       And it is checkable rather than a matter of faith: copal-gpu in the
#       guest says which half is doing the work. GPU=plain is the way back.
#
#   DirectoryShareMode=VirtFS  The 9p share. The PATH is not here: UTM keeps
#       it in its Registry as a security-scoped bookmark that only the app can
#       mint, so it is chosen once in the UI. See the note printed after
#       create.

Built by utm-vm.sh from a copal-prep.sh image.

If the graphical console will not accept typing, switch UTM's display:
    the VM window's toolbar -&gt; Displays -&gt; Serial 1
That console is a plain UART and always works.

First boot:  login 'root', password BLANK (just Enter).
Then:        ls /media/  and  sh /media/vda1/copal-init.sh
After stage 3 the path becomes /boot/copal-init.sh.

SSH, once stage 1 has configured the network:
    utm/utm-vm.sh ip --target ${TARGET}    # find the guest address
    ssh root@192.168.64.x

Shared folder, once set in Settings &gt; Sharing:
    stage 1 mounts it at /mnt/share and keeps it across reboots
    (~/Shared is a symlink to it). To do it by hand:

# Two UTM preferences decide whether this guest is pleasant or dangerous, and
# neither lives in the VM bundle -- they are application-wide, so utm-vm.sh
# reports on them rather than writing them behind your back.
#
# The problem they solve: the Mac's Command key arrives in the guest as Super,
# which is i3's modifier for everything. So every i3 binding is also a macOS
# shortcut, and three of them end the session -- Cmd+W stops the VM mid-write,
# Cmd+Q quits UTM and every machine in it, Cmd+Shift+Q logs out of macOS. The
# guest cannot defend itself: the key is taken by the host before the guest is
# offered it, so there is no binding, grab or 'nop' that helps.
#
# IsCapsLockKey is the fix. Copal's .xinitrc maps Caps Lock to a second Super
# key, and macOS reserves nothing on Caps Lock -- so CapsLock+W is "tabbed
# layout" and Cmd+W is still "stop the machine", and you simply stop using the
# second one. But UTM swallows Caps Lock as a host-synchronised toggle unless
# this is on, and then the remap has nothing to remap.
#
# NoQuitConfirmation is the seatbelt for the times you press Cmd+W anyway.
# Set to true it closes the window with no dialog, which is how a VM gets
# stopped out from under you with no warning at all.
#
# The Fn / globe key cannot be pressed into service here, which is the first
# thing everyone asks: macOS handles Fn in the keyboard driver and emits no
# key event for it, there is no USB HID usage code to send, and UTM contains
# no reference to it. It never reaches the guest in any form.

  The shared folder is already set -- $SHARE_DIR, pointed at
  by asking UTM to record it rather than by clicking through its settings.
  Change it later with:  utm/utm-vm.sh share --target $TARGET --share DIR

  Stage 1 mounts it at /mnt/share and keeps it there, in fstab with nofail,
  with ~/Shared and ~/Downloads/SharedVM pointing at it.

  Then start it:

      utm/utm-vm.sh start --target $TARGET

  First boot: log in as 'root' with a BLANK password, then

      ls /media/                      # expect vda1
      sh /media/vda1/copal-init.sh    # the fifteen stages

  A SLOW DISPLAY, if the desktop feels like it is drawing through mud: the
  first thing to check is that stage 4 has been run recently enough to have
  installed the modesetting driver. In the guest:

      grep -l modesetting /var/log/Xorg.0.log >/dev/null && echo good

  A guest still on xf86-video-fbdev is drawing every pixel twice through the
  kernel's framebuffer emulation, and re-running stage 4 is the whole fix.
  Only once that is right is the host end worth touching:

      copal-gpu

  in the guest, which says which display device the kernel found, whether the
  host offered VirGL, and which driver X ended up on. On aarch64 this machine
  was created with virtio-ramfb-gl -- VirGL acceleration through the Mac's
  GPU, plus a plain framebuffer the firmware draws on before any driver has
  loaded, so the window shows the UEFI menu and the boot messages rather than
  going black until Linux is up.

  If copal-gpu says the acceleration did not take, the guest is simply
  unaccelerated rather than broken, and re-creating with

      GPU=plain utm/utm-vm.sh create --target $TARGET --name something-else

  drops back to the paravirtualised GPU with no VirGL at all.

  IF THE GRAPHICAL CONSOLE WILL NOT TYPE, switch UTM to the serial display:

      the VM window's toolbar  ->  Displays  ->  Serial 1

  That console is a plain UART with a driver built into the kernel, so it works
  before anything has been loaded out of modloop, and it is the one to use if
  the window takes no keystrokes. Both are wired up on purpose: the graphical
  one is for watching i3 come up, the serial one is for when it cannot.

  Stage 1 is what configures the network. Until it has run, eth0 is down and
  the guest has no address -- that is Alpine's diskless default, not a fault.

  THE KEYBOARD. Once stage 4 has put a desktop up, use CAPS LOCK where the key
  list says Super. The Mac's Command key arrives in the guest as Super, so i3's
  bindings double as macOS shortcuts and three of them end the session: Cmd+W
  stops this machine mid-write, Cmd+Q quits UTM and every machine in it, and
  Cmd+Shift+Q logs out of macOS. Caps Lock is mapped to a second Super inside
  the guest and macOS claims nothing on it, so the same bindings become safe.
  Nothing in the guest can protect the Command key itself -- the host takes it
  first.

#     update registry -- "Currently you can only change the shared directory

# copal-prep.sh --refresh rewrites only the small generated files -- answers.txt,
# copal.conf, copal-init.sh -- on a medium that is already written, so a machine
# picks up installer changes without being rebuilt. It works through hdiutil,
# which cannot attach a qcow2, so the disk is converted out and back. Both
# directions are lossless and everything the guest has written survives.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------- export ---
#
# UTM's disk, back out as a raw image.
#
# WHY THIS IS NEEDED AT ALL. `create` converts the raw image into a qcow2
# inside the bundle, because that is what UTM understands -- so from that
# moment the machine you use in UTM and the file in build/ are two different
# disks. Install into UTM and build/copal-vm.img still holds the pristine,
# uninstalled system. Nothing warns you: both exist, both boot, and only one
# of them has your desktop on it.
#
# That matters because `make screens` photographs the IMAGE. Install in UTM,
# run make screens, and you get pictures of a login prompt -- a genuinely
# confusing result, since the desktop you are looking at in UTM is real.
#
# So: install wherever you like, export, and every image-based tool works on
# what you actually built.
